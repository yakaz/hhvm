Description: Hip-Hop virtual machine, runtime, and JIT for the PHP language
 HHVM (aka the HipHop Virtual Machine) is an open-source virtual machine
 designed for executing programs written in Hack and PHP. HHVM uses a
 just-in-time compilation approach to achieve superior performance while
 maintaining the flexibility that PHP developers are accustomed to
 .
 To date, HHVM (and its predecessor HPHPc before it) has realized over a
 9x increase in web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory
 consumption for Facebook compared with the PHP 5.2 engine + APC.
